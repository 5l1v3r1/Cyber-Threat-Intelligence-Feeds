## Malware Domains

The DNS-BH project creates and maintains a listing of domains that are known to
be used to propagate malware and spyware. This project creates the Bind and
Windows zone files required to serve fake replies to localhost for any requests
to these, thus preventing many spyware installs and reporting.
