## OpenPhish

OpenPhish launched in June 2014 as a result of a three-year research project on
phishing detection. The research yielded a set of autonomous algorithms for
detecting zero-day phishing sites. These algorithms form a self-contained kernel
that can tell whether a given URL is a phish or not. Essentially, OpenPhish is
the algorithmic kernel complemented with data extraction and analysis
functionalities for generating various feeds.

### Phishing

OpenPhish uses proprietary Artificial Intelligence algorithms to automatically
identify zero-day phishing sites and provide comprehensive, actionable,
real-time threat intelligence.
