## The CINS Score

CINS is an IP reputation database that provides an accurate and timely score for
any IP address in the world.

### The CI Army List

CI Army is a way for our company to give back to the community by sharing
valuable threat intelligence harvested from our CINS system. The CI Army list is
a subset of the CINS Active Threat Intelligence ruleset, and consists of IP
addresses that meet two basic criteria: 1) The IP's recent Rogue Packet score
factor is very poor, and 2) The InfoSec community has not yet identified the IP
as malicious.
